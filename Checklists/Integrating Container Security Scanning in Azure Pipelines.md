# üê≥ Integrating Container Security Scanning in Azure Pipelines

Containerization, using technologies like Docker, has become a popular way to package and deploy applications. Ensuring the security of your container images is crucial, as vulnerabilities within these images can lead to significant security risks in your deployed applications. Integrating container security scanning into your Azure Pipelines automates the process of identifying these vulnerabilities.

This guide will explain the importance of container security scanning and provide conceptual YAML examples for integrating popular tools like Aqua Security, Twistlock, and Azure Container Registry scanning.

## üõ°Ô∏è Why Scan Container Images?

Container images can contain vulnerabilities in their base operating system, application dependencies, and the application code itself. Scanning these images helps to:

* **Identify Known Vulnerabilities:** Detect publicly disclosed vulnerabilities (CVEs) in the image layers.
* **Ensure Compliance:** Verify that your container images meet security and compliance requirements.
* **Prevent Deployment of Vulnerable Images:** Stop vulnerable containers from being deployed to your environments.
* **Gain Visibility:** Understand the security posture of your containerized applications.

## üõ†Ô∏è Integrating Container Security Scanning Tools

Here's how you can conceptually integrate popular container security scanning tools into your Azure Pipelines using YAML:

**Example 1: Aqua Security (Using Aqua CLI)**

```yaml
steps:
- task: CmdLine@2
  inputs:
    script: |
      # Assuming Aqua CLI is installed and configured on your agent
      aqua scan --registry $(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/your-registry --image your-image:$(Build.BuildId) --fail-on high
    displayName: 'Run Aqua Security Scan'
```

**Example 2: Twistlock (Using Twistcli)**

```yaml
steps:
- task: CmdLine@2
  inputs:
    script: |
      # Assuming Twistcli is installed and configured on your agent
      ./twistcli scan --address <your_console_address> --token <your_api_token> --details --fail_on_severity high --image your-registry/your-image:$(Build.BuildId)
    displayName: 'Run Twistlock Scan'
```

**Example 3: Azure Container Registry (ACR) Scanning (using `az acr task`)**

Azure Container Registry offers a built-in vulnerability scanning feature powered by Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You can trigger these scans as part of your pipeline using the Azure CLI.

```yaml
steps:
- task: AzureCLI@2
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'your-azure-subscription'
    scriptType: 'bash'
    scriptLocation: 'inlineScript'
    inlineScript: |
      REGISTRY_NAME="youracrregistry"
      IMAGE_NAME="your-image"
      TAG=$(Build.BuildId)

      az acr task create \
        --registry $REGISTRY_NAME \
        --name acrscan-$(Build.BuildId) \
        --image "$IMAGE_NAME:$TAG" \
        --schedule "0 5 * * *" # Optional: Schedule for regular scans
    displayName: 'Trigger ACR Security Scan'
```

**Note:** ACR scanning results are typically found within the Azure portal under your Container Registry and Microsoft Defender for Cloud. You might need additional scripting to pull these results directly into your pipeline for failure conditions.

## üìù Key Considerations for Container Security Scanning

* **Tool Selection:** Choose a container scanning tool that integrates well with your container registry and provides the level of detail and reporting you need.
* **Registry Integration:** Ensure your chosen tool can access your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Azure Container Registry, etc.).
* **Authentication:** Configure the necessary credentials for the scanning tool to pull and analyze your images.
* **Severity Levels:** Define the severity levels at which the pipeline should fail (e.g., fail on "high" or "critical" vulnerabilities).
* **Base Image Security:** Consider the security of your base images and establish a process for updating them regularly.
* **Scanning Frequency:** Determine how often you need to scan your container images (e.g., on every build, on a schedule).
* **Reporting and Remediation:** Integrate the scan results into your workflow for vulnerability tracking and remediation.

By integrating container security scanning into your Azure Pipelines, you can ensure that the container images you deploy are free of known vulnerabilities, significantly improving the security of your containerized applications on Azure. üê≥

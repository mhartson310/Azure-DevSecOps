### Using Azure DevOps Secrets Checklist

Azure DevOps allows you to define secret variables directly within your pipeline settings or variable groups. These secrets are stored securely and are masked in the pipeline logs.

**Steps:**

1.  **Define Secret Variables:**
    * **Pipeline Settings (YAML):** In your `azure-pipelines.yml` file, under the `variables` section, define a variable with the `isSecret` property set to `true`.
    * **Variable Groups:** In **Pipelines** > **Library** > **Variable groups**, create a new variable or edit an existing one and check the "Secret" checkbox.
2.  **Use Secrets in Your Pipeline:** Access these secret variables using the `$(VariableName)` syntax in your pipeline tasks.

**YAML Example:**

```yaml
variables:
- name: ApiKey
  value: 'your-super-secret-api-key'
  isSecret: true

steps:
- task: PowerShell@2
  inputs:
    targetType: 'inline'
    script: |
      Write-Host "Using API Key: $(ApiKey)"
      # Use the secret in your API calls
```

**Important Considerations for Azure DevOps Secrets:**

* Secrets defined directly in YAML files are scoped to that specific pipeline.
* Secrets in variable groups can be shared across multiple pipelines.
* While masked in logs, ensure you don't inadvertently print secret values in your scripts.

### 3. Avoiding Hardcoding Secrets

The most critical practice is to **never hardcode secrets directly in your pipeline definitions, scripts, or configuration files**. This includes:

* Embedding connection strings directly in scripts.
* Storing API keys in configuration files that are committed to source control.
* Passing sensitive information as plain text parameters.

### 4. Using Secure File Copy Tasks

If you need to transfer files containing sensitive information (e.g., certificates), use the secure file copy task in Azure Pipelines. This task encrypts the files during transit and ensures they are handled securely on the agent.

### 5. Limiting Permissions

Grant only the necessary permissions to the service principals or managed identities used by your pipelines. Follow the principle of least privilege to minimize the potential impact of a compromised credential.

### 6. Regularly Rotating Secrets

Establish a process for regularly rotating your secrets (e.g., passwords, API keys) in Azure Key Vault and updating them in your pipelines.

### 7. Auditing Secret Usage

Monitor the usage of secrets and access to your Key Vault to detect any suspicious activity.

## In Summary

Securely managing secrets is a fundamental aspect of DevSecOps. By leveraging Azure Key Vault and Azure DevOps Secrets, and strictly avoiding hardcoding, you can significantly reduce the risk of exposing sensitive information in your Azure Pipelines and ensure a more secure development and deployment process. Remember to choose the method that best suits your needs and always prioritize security when handling credentials.
